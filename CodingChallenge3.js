/*John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants.
The bills were $124, $48 and $268.  
To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).
He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between
$50 and $200 and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1. Containing all 3 tips (one for each bill)
2. Containing all 3 final paid amounts ( Bill + tip).

Note: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2 */
