# LEARNING-JAVASCRIPT-
This is my JAVASCRIPT learning progress 

Day 1: 24th May 2020
learnt : Variables and Data types
         Variable mutation and type coercion
         Basic operators
         
Also i was able to solve a javascript error i thought for my restraurant project through starting to learn Javascript.
The error or rather the mistake i had was linking the javascript file in the index.html file.Am glad i got around it . 
a very simple error but i learnt.
